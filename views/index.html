				<p>
					I have a desire and passion to work in the IT industry. I’ve been an avid programmer since I was 10,
					and
					have always taken pride in my ability to press forward and improve both myself and the results of my
					work.<br /><br />
					I completed my work experience program with a technology company based in Lowestoft where I was
					offered and
					completed a 6-week paid work assignment after my initial 2 weeks.<br /><br />
					I had an initial years worth of experience via an apprenticeship, where I did full stack software
					development. I was offered a job after the initial year.

					<h3>April 2017 - July 2018<span>Naked Element (Junior Developer)</span></h3>
					<span>After going to college, I decided to take an apprenticeship, where I worked with Naked Element. Here  I learnt how to create express based node servers for a front end website, and Springboot java based applications for the backend of a website, which communicated with a Postgres database. When working, I also learned how to deal with customer wants and needs, and learned how to manage time effectively to get tasks done within a certain time frame. I also got to work with Linux servers, and found out how to set up and manage servers. I was asked to stay after my apprenticeship, as I was a valuable asset to the business. </span>
